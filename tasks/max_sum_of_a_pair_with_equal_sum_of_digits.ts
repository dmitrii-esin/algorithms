// You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers. You can choose two indices i and j, such that i != j, and the sum of digits of the number nums[i] is equal to that of nums[j].

// Return the maximum value of nums[i] + nums[j] that you can obtain over all possible indices i and j that satisfy the conditions.

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [18,43,36,13,7]
// Output: 54
// Explanation: The pairs (i, j) that satisfy the conditions are:
// - (0, 2), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 9, and their sum is 18 + 36 = 54.
// - (1, 4), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 7, and their sum is 43 + 7 = 50.
// So the maximum sum that we can obtain is 54.

// Example 2:
// Input: nums = [10,12,19,14]
// Output: -1
// Explanation: There are no two numbers that satisfy the conditions, so we return -1.

function maximumSum(nums: number[]): number {
  return -1;
}

console.log("!!maximumSum([18,43,36,13,7])", maximumSum([18, 43, 36, 13, 7])); // 54
console.log("!!maximumSum([10,12,19,14])", maximumSum([10, 12, 19, 14])); // -1
