# Coding tasks

> This repo includes my efforts, notes and examples of cracking codings tasks, algorithms and data structures based on **[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/sunndeath/)** and **[Cracking the coding interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)** book

## My notes

### stable / unstable (sorting by two or more different criteria)

### efficiency or complexity (what to track to check algorithm effectiveness): time and space

### How to solve algorithmic problems/exercises
- understand details, constraints and corner cases
- use whitebox/note for brainstorm
- find pattern
- try naive/brute-force -> optimizing
- try to look into problem intuitively (with real life objects context)
- find errors in corner cases (length - 2, i = 1, etc.)
- optimize: remove unnecessary work, caching repeatable steps, pre-compute initial data. modularize, think about time vs. space tradeoffs
- try use resolving small problem and apply to big problem
- choose appropriate technics or algorithm (iteration, recursion, two-pointer, fast & slow pointers, sliding window, sorting, swapping, divide and conquer, etc.)
- choose appropriate additional data-structures if needed (hash map, array, linked list, queue, stack, tree, additional constant or variable etc.)

### list of technics
- sliding window
- two-pointer
- backtracking
- dp
