// k-nearest neighbour

// Good for recommend system, classification, regression

// empiric rule - how much items required? for N we should scan N^2 neighbours

// How to: build cartesian plane XY (or ABCXYZ...) then calc distance netween 2 points
// We sould calc distance using Pythagorean theorem
// Formula: distance = Math.cbrt( (a1 - a2)**2 + (b1 - b2)**2 + (c1 - c2)**2 ... );
